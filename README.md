# Event-Planner Degrazia

## Project Requirements

You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past eight modules to create a real-world full-stack application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfill the following requirements:

- Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.

- Use React for the front end.

- Use PostgreSQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.

- Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.

- Use at least two server-side APIs.

- Have a folder structure that follows the separation of concerns design principle.

- Include authentication using JWT.

- Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.

- Be deployed using Render (with data).

- Have a polished UI.

- Be responsive.

- Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

- Meet good-quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

- Have a professional README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
